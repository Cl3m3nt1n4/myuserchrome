minimal userChrome.css Windows frendly version
============

Hi everyone, 

This is my modified version of https://github.com/turing753/myuserchrome minimal user minimal userChrome.css.

The objective of this version is to be a bit more Microsoft Windows friendly while still perseving as much as possible the original look.

Some of modifications/ideas of this version are:

What is changed:

+ Added thin scroll bar instead of the originally being hidden.

+ Change some padding to make it look more natural on windows. 

+ Changed Font Family in order to get the bold monospace look like the original. Changed font size as well

+ Inverted the URL Barl / Tab bar order due the Windows minimize/maximize/close being not at the corner of the program.

+ Tabs start now closer to the top right corner and have different height and width rules.

Problems to be fixed: 

+ When on windowed mode at the top left appears a white line. 

Possible future changes: 

+ Removing http/https to make links loke more simple (similar to Chrome aproach).
