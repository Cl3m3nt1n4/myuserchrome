minimal userChrome.css Windows friendly version
============

Hi everyone, 

This is my modified version of https://github.com/turing753/myuserchrome minimal userChrome.css.

The objective of this version is to be a bit more Microsoft Windows friendly while still perseving as much as possible the original look.

Some of modifications/ideas of this version are:

What is changed:

+ Added thin dark themed scroll bar instead of the originally hidden setting.

+ Change some padding to make it look more natural on windows. 

+ Changed Font Family in order to get the bold monospace look like the original. Changed font size as well.

+ Tabs start now closer to the top left corner and have different height and width rules.

+ Added dark context menu.

+ Link preview background is now dark themed.

+ Added close tab button on hover. 

+ Pinned tabs now show icon. (On the original css they don't make impossible to use such feature)

Problems to be fixed: 

+ When on windowed mode at the top left appears a white line. 


Note: Please keep in mind that all changes are merged to Github without much testing since I treat this as a alpha project.
