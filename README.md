minimal userChrome.css Windows frendly version
============

Hi everyone, 

This is my modified version from https://github.com/turing753/myuserchrome. 

This version aims to be a bit more Microsoft Windows friendly while still perseving as much as possible the original look.

The modifications made include:

Whats changed:

+ Changed Font Weight.

+ Added a thin scroll bar instead of the original hidden one.

+ Change some padding to make it as small as possible footprint but having a normal looking size on Windows. 

+ Changed Font Size to be smaller.

+ Inverted the URL Barl / Tab bar order due the Windows minimize/maximize/close being not at the corner of the program. 

Problems to be fixed: 

+ When on windowed mode at the top left appear a white
 line. 
+ Font doesn't have a bold look like the original. 

+ Some padding doesn't look natural on Windows still. 

Possible future changes: 

+ Removing http/https from the link (making just a lock) to look more minimal.
