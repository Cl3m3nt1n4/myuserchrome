## UPDATE: This is no longer supported. If you want to use it, it's working on Firefox 70/71 only, anything after that will break pretty much everything. 

This was a funny project, my first of this kind, a lot of this was copied and pasted, didn't understand everything but learned a lot of stuff from it. 

## Original README: 

minimal userChrome.css Windows friendly version
============

Hi everyone, 

This is my modified version of https://github.com/turing753/myuserchrome minimal userChrome.css.

The objective of this version is to be a bit more Microsoft Windows friendly while still perseving as much as possible the original look.

Some of modifications/ideas of this version are:

What is changed:

+ Added thin dark themed scroll bar instead of the originally hidden setting.
+ Change some padding to make it look more natural on windows. 
+ Tabs start now closer to the top left corner and have different height and width rules.
+ Added dark context menu.
+ Link preview background is now dark themed.
+ Added close tab button on hover (replaces fav icon). 

Problems to be fixed: 

+ When on windowed mode at the top left appears a white line. 

Note: Please keep in mind that all changes are merged to Github without much testing since I treat this as a alpha project.
